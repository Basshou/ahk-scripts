# ahk-scripts

Bunch of AHK scripts that I use on Windows.<br>

## AltDrag

alt+m1 = drag window<br>
alt+m2 = resize window<br>
alt+m3 = maximise/minimise window<br>

## CapsEscape

Change caps lock to esc <br>

## HideTaskbar

Pressing f3 will hide/unhide the taskbar<br>

## M3Close

Click m3 on an app's taskbar and it will close the app (as opposed to Windows default behaviour of opening another app).<br>

## MouseVolume

win+scroll up = increase volume<br>
win+scroll down = decrease volume<br>
win+m3 = mute<br>
Note: This applies globally.<br>

## OnTop

Ctrl+Spacebar will make the currently active window stay on top.<br>

## SnapWin

win+left arrow = current active window snap left<br>
win+right arrow = current active window snap right<br>
win+up arrow = maximise current active window<br>
Note: This behaviour is present in Windows, but it seems to be a bit janky, which is why I'm using this script.<br>

## TaskbarVolume

Scroll up or down on the taskbar in order to increase and decrease global volume.<br>

## VirtualDesktops

alt+f1 = go to the next desktop to the right<br>
alt+f2 = go to the next desktop to the left<br>

## VolumeOSD

f4 to disable/enable Windows 10 volume osd, script is suspended by default. <br>
note: Bit unstable when changing volume via **MouseVolume**.

## cmd

win+enter = open and maximised a cmd, opens in C:/ by default.<br>
