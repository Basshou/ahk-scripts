# ahk-scripts
bunch of ahk scripts that I use on Windows

## AltDrag
alt+m1 = drag window
alt+m2 = resize window
alt+m3 = maximise/minimise window

## HideTaskbar
f3 = hide taskbar
f4 = show taskbar

## M3Close
Click m3 on an app's taskbar and it will close the app (as oppose to Windows default behaviour of opening another app)

## Mouse_Volume
alt+scroll up = increase volume
alt+scroll down = decrease volume
win+m3 = mute
note: This apply globally

## OnTop
ctrl+spacebar will make current active window ontop

## SnapWin
win+left arrow = current active window snap left
win+right arrow = current active window snap right
win + up arrow = maximise current active window
note: This behaviour is present in Windows, but it seems to be bit janky which is why I'm using this script.

## TaskbarVolume
scroll up or down on taskbar in order to increase and decrease global volume

## VirtualDesktops
alt+f1 = go to the next desktop to the right
alt+f2 = go to the next desktop to the left

## cmd.ahk
win+enter = open and maximised a cmd
